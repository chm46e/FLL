## First Lego League code
Code for our robotics team using LEGO SPIKE Prime and <a href="https://github.com/sanjayseshan/spikeprime-vscode">spikeprime-vscode</a>.\
The program deals with all of the logic and creates a simple to use robot control environment.\
It's quite simple, even our 4th graders could figure it out!\
**(This readme is early stage and is missing a lot of critical information.)**

### How do I use it?
1. Copy ```main.py``` or clone repository.
2. Install the Spike Prime vscode extension.
3. Search for **```TODO:```** in the ```main.py``` and modify accordingly.
   * This involves changing PORT values and additional info.
4. Please read <a href="https://github.com/chm46e/FirstLegoLeague/edit/master/README.md#what-do-i-need-to-know">What do I need to know?</a>
   * Trust me, this is suuuper required.
6. Connect to the robot. (<a href="https://github.com/chm46e/FirstLegoLeague/edit/master/README.md#how-do-i-connect-to-the-robot">How do I connect to the robot?</a>)
7. Upload it to the robot. (look at the top-right buttons)

### What do I need to know?
(optional: more detailed description <a href="https://github.com/chm46e/FirstLegoLeague/edit/master/README.md#closer-look-at-the-program">here</a>)\
When you launch the program, it goes to a internal menu. You can move around in the internal menu just like in the external menu.\
The internal menu looks identical to external. (FIX: should be changed)\
You can get out of there with holding (minimal) both left and right buttons.
TODO

In a nutshell of the code:
* class API at line 39 to 456:\
This contains all of the logic on robot control. This can be completely ignored.
* main() at line 456 to 532:\
This contains the loop. TODO
* exec_0() exec_1() etc at line 532 to setup:

### Closer look at the program
The internal menu gives us direct control over the and has a slight performance improvement.\
